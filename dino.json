    "time": "242 million years ago",
    "description": "Prestosuchus chiniquensis was a large rauisuchian archosaur, at a length of 5 metres (16 feet) from nose to tail. It was discovered in the South American country of Brazil.  It lived in Brazil (Paleorrota) of the late Triassic Period. It had powerful legs, indicating it was a fast running animal. It eats small dinosaurs and aetosaurs."

    "id": 2,
    "name": "Coelophysis",
    "time": "228 million years ago",
    "description": "Coelophysis was a primitive theropod dinosaur. Usually growing to length of about 2 metres (6.6 feet), it was very light, weighing only about 18–23 kg (40–50 pounds), and had a long, slender neck, tail, and hind legs. The head was long and narrow, and the jaws were equipped with many sharp teeth."

    "id": 3,
    "name": "Iguanadon",
    "time": "161 million years ago",
    "description": "Iguanodon was the largest, best known, and most widespread of all the iguanodontids (family Iguanodontidae), which are closely related to the hadrosaurs, or duck-billed dinosaurs. Iguanodon was 9 metres (30 feet) long, stood nearly 2 metres tall at the hip, and weighed four to five tons."

    "id": 4,
    "name": "Stegosaurus",
    "time": "151 million years ago",
    "description": "A large, slow moving plant-eater, Stegosaurus would have defended itself from predators like Allosaurus and Ceratosaurus with its powerful spiked tail. The bony plates along its back were embedded in the skin of the animal, not attached to its skeleton, which is why in most fossil finds the plates are separated from the body."

    "id": 5,
    "name": "Pterodactyl",
    "time": "150 million years ago",
    "description": "Pterodactylus (meaning `winged finger`) is an extinct genus of pterosaurs, whose members are commonly known as pterodactyls ( /ˌtɛrəˈdæktɪlz/). It is thought to contain only a single species, Pterodactylus antiquus, the first pterosaur species to be named and identified as a flying reptile. It was a carnivore and probably preyed upon fish and other small animals. Like all pterosaurs, Pterodactylus had wings formed by a skin and muscle membrane stretching from its elongated fourth finger to its hind limbs. It was supported internally by collagen fibres and externally by keratinous ridges."

    "id": 6,
    "name": "Brachiosaurus",
    "time": "146 million years ago",
    "description": "Brachiosaurs were built like huge giraffes; they had immensely long necks and relatively short tails. Their morphology is unusual among dinosaurs in that the forelimbs were longer than the hind limbs. These adaptations apparently enabled them to lift their heads to about 12 metres (39 feet) above the ground in order to browse the branches of tall trees. Brachiosaurs attained a maximum length approaching 25 metres and a weight of nearly 80 metric tons."

  {
    "id": 7,
    "name": "Spinosaurus",
    "time": "100 million years ago",
    "description": "Spinosaurus, or “spined reptile,” was named for its “sail-back” feature, created by tall vertebral spines. It was named by German paleontologist Ernst Stromer in 1915 on the basis of the discovery of a partial skeleton from Bahariya Oasis in western Egypt by his assistant Richard Markgraf. These fossils were destroyed in April 1944 when British aircraft inadvertently bombed the museum in Munich in which they were housed."

  {
    "id": 8,
    "name": "Velociraptor",
    "time": "75 million years ago",
    "description": "Velociraptor, (genus Velociraptor), sickle-clawed dinosaur that flourished in central and eastern Asia during the Late Cretaceous Period (99 million to 65 million years ago). It is closely related to the North American Deinonychus of the Early Cretaceous in that both reptiles were dromaeosaurs. Both possessed an unusually large claw on each foot, as well as ossified tendon reinforcements in the tail."

  {
    "id": 9,
    "name": "Tyrannosaurus Rex",
    "time": "70 million years ago",
    "description": "Like other tyrannosaurids, Tyrannosaurus was a bipedal carnivore with a massive skull balanced by a long, heavy tail. Relative to its large and powerful hind limbs, Tyrannosaurus forelimbs were short but unusually powerful for their size and had two clawed digits. The most complete specimen measures up to 12.3 m (40 ft) in length though T. rex could grow to lengths of over 12.3 m (40 ft), up to 3.66 meters (12 ft) tall at the hips."

  {
    "id": 10,
    "name": "Triceratops",
    "time": "68 million years ago",
    "description": "Triceratops, (genus Triceratops), large quadrupedal plant-eating ceratopsian dinosaur that had a frill of bone at the back of its skull and three prominent horns. Fossils of “three-horned face,” as its Latin name is usually translated, date to the final 3 million years of the Cretaceous Period (145.5 million to 65.5 million years ago), making it one of the last of the non-avian dinosaurs to have evolved."
